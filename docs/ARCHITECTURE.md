# OpenFinance — Architecture & Plan

> Status: living document. Captures the target architecture and the phased plan to evolve
> the current demo backend into a scalable, stable, read-only financial aggregation product
> for the **Canadian** market, built and operated at **zero cost** until real scale justifies spend.

## 1. Product goal

A mobile-first app (Flutter) that lets a Canadian user securely connect their **banking and
brokerage accounts** and see everything in one place: balances, holdings, transactions, and net
worth over time. **Read-only** aggregation only — no payments, no trading (for now).

## 2. Guiding constraints

| Constraint | Decision |
|---|---|
| Market | Canada. Consumer-driven banking (open banking) is legislated but **not yet live**, so we bridge with aggregators now and adopt the official APIs later behind an abstraction. |
| Scope | Read-only aggregation. Lowest regulatory burden; fastest path to a stable, demoable product. |
| Stage | Fundable MVP — front-load security and clean architecture, defer operational spend. |
| Budget | **$0 right now.** Prefer self-hosted/OSS over paid services. Paid/free-tier AWS services are *chosen and documented* but **deferred** until deployment. |
| Cloud | AWS (when we deploy). |
| Stack | Keep **.NET 8** (backend) + **Flutter** (frontend). Evolve patterns, do not rewrite. |

## 3. Target architecture

```
Flutter app
   │  link account via provider SDK/redirect; data via our API (JWT-authenticated)
   ▼
.NET 8 API ───────────────► Auth (self-hosted JWT now → AWS Cognito free tier later)
   │  per-user authorization, DTOs, validation
   ├── Background sync (IHostedService now → SQS + worker later)
   │        │ pulls via IAggregationProvider, normalizes, persists
   │        ▼
   ├── PostgreSQL (Neon free tier now → RDS/Aurora later)
   ├── Encrypted token store (app-level encryption now → AWS KMS later)
   └── Webhook endpoint ◄──── aggregator push notifications
```

### The key abstraction: `IAggregationProvider`

Every external data source sits behind one interface so the domain and app never depend on a
specific vendor. This is what makes the product both **swappable** (avoid lock-in / cost) and
**futureproof** (drop in Canada's official open-banking APIs when they go live).

```
IAggregationProvider
 ├─ MockProvider                  (sandbox/demo data — zero cost, used for the MVP build)
 ├─ FlinksProvider / PlaidProvider (banking — added when budget allows a sandbox key)
 ├─ SnapTradeProvider             (brokerage — added likewise)
 └─ CanadianOpenBankingProvider   (official APIs — when the ecosystem is live)
```

Methods: `CreateLinkSession`, `ExchangeToken`, `FetchAccounts`, `FetchHoldings`,
`FetchTransactions`, `HandleWebhook`.

## 4. Zero-budget service choices (AWS)

Everything needed for the MVP runs free locally and on free tiers. Paid items are explicitly deferred.

| Concern | Now ($0) | Later (AWS, when justified) |
|---|---|---|
| Identity / auth | **Self-hosted JWT** in ASP.NET Core + built-in `PasswordHasher` (no external service) | AWS Cognito (free tier: 50k MAU) |
| Database | **Neon** Postgres free tier (already in use) | RDS / Aurora Serverless |
| Secrets | `dotnet user-secrets` (local) + env vars | AWS Secrets Manager / SSM Parameter Store |
| Token encryption | App-level envelope encryption with a key from config | AWS KMS |
| Background sync | `IHostedService` in-process | SQS + a worker service (ECS Fargate) |
| Hosting | Local / free container hosts | ECS Fargate or App Runner |
| CI/CD | **GitHub Actions** (free for the repo) | same |
| Observability | Serilog to console/file (OSS) | CloudWatch / OpenTelemetry → AWS |
| Account data | **MockProvider** (sandbox data) | Flinks/Plaid + SnapTrade sandbox → production keys |

**Principle:** nothing in the MVP requires a credit card. Aggregator integration is deferred until
there's a reason to pay for it; until then the `MockProvider` exercises the full pipeline end-to-end.

## 5. Domain model (target)

Generalizes today's `clients / connections / banks / cash|stock|mutual_fund (+ *_info)` into:

- **User** (← `clients`) — linked to the auth identity; **no plaintext password**.
- **Institution** (← `banks`) — + provider identifiers.
- **Connection** (← `connections`) — a linked login: `provider`, `provider_item_id`,
  **encrypted token reference**, `status`, `last_synced_at`.
- **Account** — one account in a connection: type/subtype (chequing, TFSA, RRSP, margin, credit),
  currency, balances. Generalizes the per-product tables.
- **Security** + **Holding** — instrument reference + position (qty, cost basis, market value).
- **Transaction** — normalized across all accounts.
- **BalanceSnapshot** — daily net-worth history (powers the analysis/charts screens).

Keep current good conventions: UTC everywhere, `AnyAsync` existence checks. **Change:** pre-compute
aggregates into snapshots instead of recomputing totals on every request.

## 6. Phased roadmap

### Phase 0 — Foundation & security hardening (in progress, $0)
Make the existing backend safe and maintainable before adding features.

- [x] Architecture & plan documented (this file)
- [x] Translate/clean all source comments; remove dead commented-out code
- [x] **Password hashing** — replace plaintext storage/compare with built-in `PasswordHasher`
- [x] **Secret hygiene** — move DB connection string out of `appsettings.json` to user-secrets/env
- [ ] **Rotate the Neon DB password** (it is exposed in git history) — *owner action, see §7*
- [ ] DI/service-layer refactor — static helpers → injected services behind interfaces
- [ ] DTOs separate from EF entities; FluentValidation + ProblemDetails
- [ ] JWT bearer auth + per-user authorization on every endpoint; enable HTTPS
- [ ] xUnit test project + Testcontainers integration tests
- [ ] GitHub Actions CI (build + test + migrations check)

### Phase 1 — Aggregation MVP ($0 via MockProvider)
- [ ] `IAggregationProvider` + `MockProvider` (sandbox data)
- [ ] Target domain model + EF migrations
- [ ] Link flow in the Flutter app; webhook endpoint; `IHostedService` sync
- [ ] App shows net worth + accounts + holdings + transactions from the pipeline

### Phase 2 — Scale & polish (mostly $0)
- [ ] BalanceSnapshot history + analysis/charts screens
- [ ] Transaction categorization; aggregate caching
- [ ] Observability; load testing
- [ ] First real aggregator behind the interface (when budget allows a sandbox key)

### Phase 3 — Native Canadian open banking (when live)
- [ ] `CanadianOpenBankingProvider`; migrate connections off aggregators where cheaper
- [ ] Re-evaluate scope expansion (payments) only if market + licensing justify it

## 7. Owner action items (cannot be automated safely)

1. **Rotate the Neon database password.** The current connection string (with credentials) was
   committed in `appsettings.json` and remains in git history, so it must be considered
   compromised. In the Neon console, reset the password, then store the new connection string via:
   ```
   dotnet user-secrets set "ConnectionStrings:DBOpenFinanceConnection" "<new-connection-string>"
   ```
   (User-secrets is enabled on the project; `appsettings.json` now ships an empty placeholder.)
2. Decide AWS region (e.g. `ca-central-1` for Canadian data residency) before any deployment.

## 8. Notes / known issues to revisit

- Login flow currently checks the password (and decrements attempts) *before* the blocked-status
  check; tighten during the auth refactor.
- Existing credential rows stored before password hashing will no longer verify — recreate test
  users (or reset the dev database) after this change.
